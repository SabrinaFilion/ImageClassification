COMP 451(Fundamentals of Machine Learning) Assignment: Image Classification Task

The objective of this task is to develop a model that assigns a numerical label to each given image. 
Each image contains a handwritten equation, and the assigned label should represent the computed result of that equation.

This task is accomplished using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented with the PyTorch library.
